# Precise Information Retrieval Using RAG and LLM

This repository houses the code and documentation for the "Precise Information Retrieval Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs)" project, as detailed in the project report by Danish Faiz for COMP8420 Advanced Natural Language Processing, Assignment 3.

## Project Overview

The project aims to address the limitations of traditional information retrieval systems by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with GPT-4. This combination offers a dynamic, scalable, and efficient method to process and retrieve information, providing accurate and context-aware responses to complex queries.

### Objectives

- **Enhance Precision:** Improve the precision of information retrieval by integrating RAG with GPT-4.
- **Increase Efficiency:** Reduce the time and computational resources required for retrieving information.
- **Scalability:** Develop a scalable solution that can handle increasing amounts of data without performance degradation.
